README 

A little tool made during a programming course in Chile. 

Main feature: optimized search for files of folder within any folder

We use recursions for each functions on the trees. 

We used a litle help from the programming blog brennan.io/ for develeopping the shell, especially to split the lines that the user would put.

The makefile contains 3 commands :
- the make(all) which will make the the object program "tarea1"

- the make clean which will clear the folder, erasing all intermediate files *.o created

- the make mrproper which will do the same thing as the make clean and remove the executable file.
