Important : we put the file listdir.c and not the listdir.o because we made modifications to this file. This is based on the listdir.c file made by Arnaud Convers during the pretarea.

We use recursions for each functions on the trees. 

We used a litle help from the programming blog brennan.io/ for develeopping the shell, especially to split the lines that the user would put.

The makefile contains 3 commands :
- the make(all) which will make the the object program "tarea1"

- the make clean which will clear the folder, erasing all intermediate files *.o created

- the make mrproper which will do the same thing as the make clean and remove the executable file.
